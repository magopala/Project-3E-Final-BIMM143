How does the Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA) protein compare between humans, mice and electric eels? 

I used the Uniprot database https://www.uniprot.org/ to search for the PIK3CA amino acid sequence in electric eels, humans and mice. From here, I downloaded the FASTA file for the sequences. 
This is the FASTA file I used for my analysis: https://www.uniprot.org/align/A20210312A94466D2655679D1FD8953E075198DA80093AER.fasta
